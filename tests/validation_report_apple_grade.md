# Validation Report: Rupture Detector System

## Executive Summary

The **Rupture Detector** underwent structured, multi-layered validation focusing on correctness, operational robustness, and interpretability. This validation suite confirms:

- **Loss-critical accuracy**: captures preventable loss events with causal traceability.
- **Volatility transparency**: enables visibility of latent instability via EWMA reference logic.
- **High fault tolerance**: gracefully handles real-world data imperfections and operational edge cases.

The system is validated as **financially interpretable, field-stable, and operationally relevant**.
